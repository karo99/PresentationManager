## Project description
Presentation Manager is a project which enables you to manage your work at preparing presentations.
The idea of making this kind of app came during the lockdown. I realized that I need such an app to manage my workflow in college.

## Technology
To make this app I used Java which I'm constantly learning. It is very important for me when app looks good, that's why I used JavaFX which enabled me to plan a clear layout. This kind of app also helped me with training object oriented programming and understanding how important is to plan everything at the beginning.

## Interface and User Guide
The main panel of an app shows us list of files in directory we are actually in, and list of checkpoints we've made for each presentation we are working on.

To start work we have to choose our directory. I've decided to use DirectoryChooser to that task.
